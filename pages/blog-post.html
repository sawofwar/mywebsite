          We've finally been getting some sunlight over the past few days! A
          welcome change from the constantly grey sky and the thick fog.

          I've applied for my first programming internships, so fingers crossed.

          Got to try out some basic local food, khachapuri and khinkali. Pity I
          can't drink the local wines.

          We have to keep looking for coins to use our lift. It'd bee too much
          of a strain on my knees to walk to the 12th (11th) floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          My sleeping schedule's completely off because of all the work and
          trying to learn and develop my projects.

          The city's very crowded when we go outside. I've never lived in a
          place like this, in a capital. There's lots of people everywhere
          hurrying to their jobs, to the shopping centres, and, simply,
          everywhere.
