        <h2>Down and out in Tbilisi</h2>
        <p>
          In December, Tbilisi is very cold compared to cities on the south
          coast of Turkey.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are renting a big old Soviet flat. The Airbnb host is lovely, but
          the musty smell's been getting on my nerves.
        </p>

        <p>
          On our first day, I got food poisoning from cheap khinkali. Still
          haven't got over that. Also, yesterday our host was very kind to bring
          me pills from the chemist's.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, there's no poetry when you're exhausted by illness. No art.

        <p>
          Waiting for our car so we can go to Antalya. Now I'm spread over one
          more city. Our <em>büyük patron</em> has overwritten the unpleasant
          memory of his distant warlord namesake.
          <em>Bunun için de teşekkür ederim</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the old home the corpse is still in place, a sinister source of
          brain-melting miasma. Next one is an <em>ice</em> war.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pit for shy wild boars and not-so-shy dogs (some of them actually
          tiny and quite intrepid!) under the balcony, however, is a perfect
          place for work when the rain shows mercy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The food is cheap, the taxis bleed-you-dry expensive, and the memories
          priceless. Weeks sprinkled with <em>gazoz</em> and conversation.
          Nights peppered with Parliament ash and shooting stars. Moments filled
          with odd prickles of a melancholy whispering coldly from the distance.
        </p>

        <p>
          I communicated with the over- and underworld over Viber and WhatsApp
          calls. Mum said her garden was now covered in snow turning to ice.
        </p>

        <p>
          On coming back in '20, we had been struck by a view of white pines.
          "This is so of this place." Never had I thought I'd get my own place
          in a pine forest.
        </p>

        <p>
          But we got on the plane and the rest was ABC: don't lose your luggage,
          download Google Translate, and don't freeze on the coach. Then meet
          all the nice people in the Trials and Tribulations. Now the Elixir is
          within arm's reach.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stories of a screaming coming across the sky. And "Don’t forget the
          real business of the War is buying and selling". The buying is being
          with people's blood.
        </p>

        <p>
          You don't have to think about all this with Fethiye's scenery around
          you, and Pynchon never crawles into your mind. An escapism that cannot
          fail to make you feel stinging guilt.

        <p>
          Work kept flooding in, moving the sleeping schedule further and deeper
          into the starry darkness. Every night the dogs started a heated
          barking contest. And it didn't scare me at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such fresh air elevates you to an ecstasy you've never have felt if
          you've lived your whole life in a big city. The peace and quiet can be
          almost intoxicating.

        <h2>Lots and lots of rain! ⛈</h2>

        <p>
          Stayed in all day. Marina had lots of work to do, and I took a day off
          from all the work I've been doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are leaving soon, and I can't help feeling a little sad about it. I
          think I've got used to the calm stability of living in this nice
          bungalow with our amazing host and his family next door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past week, I've been trying to learn Turkish. It was only
          when our fourth week here started when I realised I could pick up some
          of the language. It turned out very useful too. Now I can even have a
          micro-conversation with our neighbours and their family!
        </p>
        <p>
          Tonight, we opened the curtain behind our glass door and saw a stray
          dog frantically wagging its tail. When we got out, it gave us the
          saddest of looks and started whimpering. I had to feed it the rest of
          my delicious salami; if I hadn't, Marina would've never forgiven me,
          haha!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's 4 AM, and the dog is sleeping on our balcony. Don't really
          know what to feel about having this new unexpected little friend.
