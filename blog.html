<p>Today we went to the Devlet Hastanesi in Fethiye, and I got my fourth jab. Our host's colleague/employee was very nice to give us a lift because otherwise it would've taken us about an hour to get there.<br>After the hospital we went to a local cafe, where I ate a doner and we both ate some dessert whose name we don't know!<br>Later we took a walk along the Fethiye Kordon towards the city centre.<br>Very tired, we got to the Erasta shopping mall. I bought some socks at LC Waikiki, and then we chilled at Erasta's Starbucks while waiting for Furkan.<br>Lovely day!<br>P.S. Our virtual parrot friend Mango died, so it was sad too. ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
