<p class="quote">"I was living on the hill <br>
  By the water tower and hiking trails"
<br>â€” FJM, <em>Leaving LA</em></p>

<p class="quote">"And then went down to the ship, <br>
  Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea"
<br>â€” Ezra Pound, <em>Canto I</em></p>

<p>Waiting for our car so we can go to Antalya. Now I'm spread over one more city. Our <em>bÃ¼yÃ¼k patron</em> has overwritten the unpleasant memory of his distant warlord namesake. <em>Bunun iÃ§in de teÅŸekkÃ¼r ederim.</em>
</p>

<p>In the old home the corpse is still in place, a sinister source of brain-melting miasma. Next one is an <em>ice</em> war.</p>

<p>The pit for shy wild boars and not-so-shy dogs (some of them actually tiny and some of them intrepid!) under the balcony, however, is a perfect place for work when the rain shows mercy.
</p>

<p>The food is cheap, the taxis bleed-you-dry expensive, and the memories priceless. Weeks sprinkled with gazoz and conversation. Nights peppered with Parliament ash and shooting stars. Moments filled with odd prickles of a melancholy whispering coldly from the distance.
</p>

<p>I communicated with the over- and underworld over Viber and WhatsApp calls. Mum said her garden was now covered in snow turning to ice.</p>

<p>On coming back in '20, we had been struck by the white pines. "The view is so of this place." Never had I thought I'd get my own place in a pine forest.</p>
<p>But we got on the plane and the rest was ABC: don't lose your luggage, download Google Translate, and don't freeze on the coach. Then meet all the nice people in the Trials and Tribulations. Now the Elixir is within arm's reach.</p>

<p class="quote">"Perhaps, after all, we were meant to meet" <br>
  â€” Thomas Pynchon, <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em></p>

<p>Stories of a screaming coming across the sky. And "Donâ€™t forget the real business of the War is buying and selling". The buying is being done not with money but with blood.
</p>

<p>You don't have to think of all this with Fethiye's scenery around you, and Pynchon never enters your mind. An escapism that cannot fail to make you feel stinging guilt.</p>

<p>Work kept flooding in, moving the sleeping schedule later and later. Every night the dogs started a heated barking contest. And it didn't scare me at all.</p>

<p>Such fresh air elevates you to an ecstasy you've never have felt if you've lived your whole life in a big city. The peace and quiet can be almost intoxicating.</p>


<p class="quote">"Melissa is a funny name for a supermarket.<br>Sounds more like a sex shop or a stripclub."</p>

<p>Bye Kons and Masha. Bye <em>patronlar</em>, <em>arkadaÅŸlar</em>, and <em>aile</em>. <em>Hepinizi seviyoruz</em>. <em>YakÄ±nda gÃ¶rÃ¼ÅŸÃ¼rÃ¼z</em>. <em>HerÅŸey iÃ§in teÅŸekkÃ¼rler</em>.</p>

          <p>Ã‡ok Ã§ok yaÄŸmur! â›ˆ</p>
          <p>Stayed in all day. Marina had lots of work to do, and I took a day off from all the work I've been doing.</p>
          <p>We are leaving soon, and I can't help feeling a little sad about it. I think I've got used to the calm stability of living in this nice bungalow with our amazing host and his family next door.</p>
          <p>Over the past week, I've been trying to learn Turkish. It was only when our fourth week here started when I realised I could pick up some of the language. It turned out very useful too. Now I can even have a micro-conversation with our neighbours and their family!</p>
          <p>Tonight, we opened the curtain behind our glass door and saw a stray dog frantically wagging its tail. When we got out, it gave us the saddest of looks and started whimpering. I had to feed it the rest of my delicious salami; if I hadn't, Marina would've never forgiven me, haha!</p>
          <p>Now it's 4 AM, and the dog is sleeping on our balcony. Don't really know what to feel about having this new unexpected little friend.</p>

<h2>19/11</h2>
<p>Today we went to the Devlet Hastanesi in Fethiye, and I got my fourth jab. Our host's colleague/employee was very nice to give us a lift because otherwise it would've taken us about an hour to get there.<br>After the hospital we went to a local cafe (which I don't remember the name of! ðŸ˜”), where I ate a doner and we both got some dessert whose name we, again, don't know!<br>Later we took a walk along the Fethiye Kordon towards the city centre.<br>Very tired, we got to the Erasta shopping mall. I bought some socks at LC Waikiki, and then we chilled at Erasta's Starbucks while waiting for Furkan, who gave us a lift home.<br>Lovely day!<br>P.S. Our virtual parrot friend Mango died, so it was sad too. ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
