          <p>We've finally been getting some sunlight over the past few days! A welcome change from the constantly grey sky and the thick fog.</p>
          <p>I've applied for my first programming internships, so fingers crossed.</p>
          <p>Got to try out some basic local food, khachapuri and khinkali. Pity I can't drink the local wines.</p>
          <p>We have to keep looking for coins to use our lift. It'd bee too much of a strain on my knees to walk to the 12th (11th) floor.</p>
          <p>My sleeping schedule's completely off because of all the work and trying to learn and develop my projects.</p>
          <p>The city's very crowded when we go outside. I've never lived in a place like this, in a capital. There's lots of people everywhere hurrying to their jobs, to the shopping centres, and, simply, everywhere.</p>

          <p>In December, Tbilisi is very cold compared to cities on the south coast of Turkey.</p>
          <p>We are renting a big old Soviet flat. The Airbnb host is lovely, but the musty smell's been getting on my nerves.</p>
          <p>On our first day, I got food poisoning from cheap khinkali. Still haven't got over that. Also, yesterday our host was very kind to bring me pills from the chemist's.</p>
          <p>Still, there's no poetry when you're exhausted by illness. No art.</p>
          <p>A grey sky and a thick fog every day.</p>

            By the water tower and hiking trails"
          <br>â€” FJM, <em>Leaving LA</em></p>

          <p class="quote">"And then went down to the ship, <br>
            Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea"
          <br>â€” Ezra Pound, <em>Canto I</em></p>

          <p>Waiting for our car so we can go to Antalya. Now I'm spread over one more city. Our <em>bÃ¼yÃ¼k patron</em> has overwritten the unpleasant memory of his distant warlord namesake. <em>Bunun iÃ§in de teÅŸekkÃ¼r ederim.</em>
          </p>

          <p>In the old home the corpse is still in place, a sinister source of brain-melting miasma. Next one is an <em>ice</em> war.</p>

          <p>The pit for shy wild boars and not-so-shy dogs (some of them actually tiny and quite intrepid!) under the balcony, however, is a perfect place for work when the rain shows mercy.
          </p>

          <p>The food is cheap, the taxis bleed-you-dry expensive, and the memories priceless. Weeks sprinkled with gazoz and conversation. Nights peppered with Parliament ash and shooting stars. Moments filled with odd prickles of a melancholy whispering coldly from the distance.
          </p>

          <p>I communicated with the over- and underworld over Viber and WhatsApp calls. Mum said her garden was now covered in snow turning to ice.</p>

          <p>On coming back in '20, we had been struck by a view of white pines. "This is so of this place." Never had I thought I'd get my own place in a pine forest.</p>
          <p>But we got on the plane and the rest was ABC: don't lose your luggage, download Google Translate, and don't freeze on the coach. Then meet all the nice people in the Trials and Tribulations. Now the Elixir is within arm's reach.</p>

          <p class="quote">"Perhaps, after all, we were meant to meet" <br>
            â€” Thomas Pynchon, <em>Gravity's Rainbow</em></p>

          <p>Stories of a screaming coming across the sky. And "Donâ€™t forget the real business of the War is buying and selling". The buying is being with people's blood.
          </p>

          <p>You don't have to think about all this with Fethiye's scenery around you, and Pynchon never crawles into your mind. An escapism that cannot fail to make you feel stinging guilt.</p>

          <p>Work kept flooding in, moving the sleeping schedule further and deeper into the starry darkness. Every night the dogs started a heated barking contest. And it didn't scare me at all.</p>

          <p>Such fresh air elevates you to an ecstasy you've never have felt if you've lived your whole life in a big city. The peace and quiet can be almost intoxicating.</p>


          <p class="quote">"Melissa is a funny name for a supermarket.<br>Sounds more like a sex shop or a stripclub."</p>

          <p>Ã‡ok Ã§ok yaÄŸmur! â›ˆ</p>
          <p>Stayed in all day. Marina had lots of work to do, and I took a day off from all the work I've been doing.</p>
          <p>We are leaving soon, and I can't help feeling a little sad about it. I think I've got used to the calm stability of living in this nice bungalow with our amazing host and his family next door.</p>
          <p>Over the past week, I've been trying to learn Turkish. It was only when our fourth week here started when I realised I could pick up some of the language. It turned out very useful too. Now I can even have a micro-conversation with our neighbours and their family!</p>
          <p>Tonight, we opened the curtain behind our glass door and saw a stray dog frantically wagging its tail. When we got out, it gave us the saddest of looks and started whimpering. I had to feed it the rest of my delicious salami; if I hadn't, Marina would've never forgiven me, haha!</p>
          <p>Now it's 4 AM, and the dog is sleeping on our balcony. Don't really know what to feel about having this new unexpected little friend.</p>

          <p>Today we went to the Devlet Hastanesi in Fethiye, and I got my fourth jab. Our host's colleague/employee was very nice to give us a lift because otherwise it would've taken us about an hour to get there.<br>After the hospital we went to a local cafe (which I don't remember the name of! ðŸ˜”), where I ate a doner and we both got some dessert whose name we, again, don't know!<br>Later we took a walk along the Fethiye Kordon towards the city centre.<br>Very tired, we got to the Erasta shopping mall. I bought some socks at LC Waikiki, and then we chilled at Erasta's Starbucks while waiting for Furkan, who gave us a lift home.<br>Lovely day!<br>P.S. Our virtual parrot friend Mango died, so it was sad too. ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
