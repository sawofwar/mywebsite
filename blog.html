          <p>Ã‡ok Ã§ok yaÄŸmur! â›ˆ</p>
          <p>Stayed in all day. Marina had lots of work to do, and I took a day off from all the work I've been doing.</p>
          <p>We are leaving soon, and I can't help feeling a little sad about it. I think I've got used to the calm stability of living in this nice bungalow with our amazing host and his family next door.</p>
          <p>Over the past week, I've been trying to learn Turkish. It was only when our fourth week here started when I realised I could pick up some of the language. It turned out very useful too. Now I can even have a micro-conversation with our neighbours and their family!</p>
          <p>Tonight, we opened the curtain behind our glass door and saw a stray dog frantically wagging its tail. When we got out, it gave us the saddest of looks and started whimpering. I had to feed it the rest of my delicious salami; if I hadn't, Marina would've never forgiven me, haha!</p>
          <p>Now it's 4 AM, and the dog is sleeping on our balcony. Don't really know what to feel about having this new unexpected little friend.</p>

<h2>19/11</h2>
<p>Today we went to the Devlet Hastanesi in Fethiye, and I got my fourth jab. Our host's colleague/employee was very nice to give us a lift because otherwise it would've taken us about an hour to get there.<br>After the hospital we went to a local cafe (which I don't remember the name of! ðŸ˜”), where I ate a doner and we both got some dessert whose name we, again, don't know!<br>Later we took a walk along the Fethiye Kordon towards the city centre.<br>Very tired, we got to the Erasta shopping mall. I bought some socks at LC Waikiki, and then we chilled at Erasta's Starbucks while waiting for Furkan, who gave us a lift home.<br>Lovely day!<br>P.S. Our virtual parrot friend Mango died, so it was sad too. ðŸ˜Ÿ</p>
